## 2026-05-17 - Lark Parser Import Bottleneck
**Learning:** Initializing the Lark parser synchronously during module import takes a significant amount of time (~50-100ms) because it parses the grammar file from disk. This slows down any script or agent importing the package, even if it doesn't parse any query.
**Action:** Always lazy-load heavy parsers (like Lark) behind a getter function when they are bound to a module-level variable.
